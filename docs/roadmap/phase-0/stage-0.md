# Stage 0: Installation and Setup

## Recap

- We have gone through the roadmap and the outline of what the course has to offer

## Setup

There are only 3 requirements that are needed for building eXpServer.

### Linux

Any distribution of Linux can be used.

### C compiler - gcc

Since we will be building the project primarily in C programming language, we will need a C compiler. We will stick with the gcc compiler for this purpose.

### GDB

Read the section on [GDB](https://nitcbase.github.io/docs/Misc/GDB) to learn how to use the GNU debugger.

## Conclusion

That is all the setup that is needed to get started on eXpServer! Letâ€™s proceed to the next stage where we will build a basic, but functional TCP server on our own.
