# Phase 0: Overview

## TCP & TCP Server

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one the core protocols of the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP), that lets two hosts connect and exchange data streams. Naturally, a TCP server is a type of server that uses TCP/IP to establish a connection and exchange data with client programs over a network.

A TCP server is responsible for listening for incoming TCP connections from client programs, accept these connections, and process the data sent by the clients.

You can read more about TCP and the TCP/IP protocol suite [here](/guides/resources/network-models).
