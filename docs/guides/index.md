# Guides

The guides feature supplementary documentation intended for your reference as you progress through the roadmap. You'll be directed to the relevant pages as necessary. These documents are broadly classified into two categories:

- **Resources:** These encompass materials and information aimed at aiding comprehension and task execution. They may include links to third-party websites for deeper understanding of specific topics.
- **References:** This category provides descriptions and code snippets related to functions and libraries that you'll utilize during implementation. They serve a similar purpose to a `README.md` file found in projects.
